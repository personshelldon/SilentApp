# SilentApp
![](AppIcon.ico)

Application that helps to workaround problem with some Samsung sound bars (Samsung HW-K450 in my case). This sound bar has auto turn off function on HDMI port if there is no any activity (sound) on it. This fucntion can not be disabled on sound bar itself (auto turn off can be disabled only on AUX port).

This application plays empty sound in a cycle and therefore sound bar sees activity and does not turn off.

### Instructions
- Download and compile in **Visual Studio**
- Run **SilentApp.exe**
- Done!

Application starts in a tray and adds itself to autorun on Windows boot. App has no any interface.
